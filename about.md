Hi, my name is Adityan. People call me CG (hence the logo). Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IIT Madras</a>. I'm a fitness enthusiast, where I like training for calisthenics skills. I like to follow new advancements in AI and embedded systems. I like playing Badminton, running or swimming in my free time.

I currently work at <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.chetak.com/">Chetak Technology Ltd</a> as an Embedded Software Engineer. My focus here includes building and testing OS level driver codes and automating the software release process. I'm an active kaggle problem solver and I like to solve CTF(Capture the Flag) problems in  <a style="color:teal" href="https://picoctf.org/">picoCTF</a> problems learning about software building vulnerabilities.
